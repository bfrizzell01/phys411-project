# Time Series Analysis of Temperature and Weather Data
A time series analysis project I worked on for PHYS 411 at UVIC, from Sept-Dec 2022. Temperature and pressure weather data across Vancouver Island over several years were analyzed and various plots of empirical distributions, spectrograms, PCA, etc. were produced. Although further domain specific knowledge would assist with results, interesting insights and visualizations of weather patterns across the island can be made. 

The data was collected by [Johannes Gemmrich](https://web.uvic.ca/~gemmrich/) of the UVic Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Department. Therefore, data is not made publicly available due to the potential for copyright infringement. The code used to perform the analysis, however, is made available [here]()

The final report can be accessed [here.](https://github.com/bfrizzell01/phys411-project/blob/main/report/project_report.pdf)
