# phys411-project
A time series analysis project I worked on for PHYS 411 at UVIC, from Sept-Dec 2022. Temperature and pressure weather data across Vancouver Island over several years were analyzed and various plots of empirical distributions, spectrograms, PCA, etc. were produced. A final report summarizing results is also included.
